Gravatar Hovercards is developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (following [BEM naming conventions](https://getbem.com/)), and is bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). For package management and script running, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Development Workflow

The general development workflow is as follows:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`. Make sure your Node version matches the minimum requirement specified in the `package.json` file.
3. Build the library in development mode using `yarn build:dev`. This command compiles the code and watches for changes.
4. **In a new terminal**, start a local server with `yarn start`. Now you can modify the code in the `src` folder and test it (or the output formats) in the `playground` directory.
5. Update or add the related types if necessary.
6. If needed, update the relevant documentation such as [README.md](https://github.com/Automattic/gravatar-hovercards/blob/trunk/README.md) or [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Automattic/gravatar-hovercards/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md).
7. Create a Pull Request with your changes.
